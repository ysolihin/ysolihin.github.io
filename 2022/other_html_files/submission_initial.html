      Prospective authors must submit papers electronically by the submission deadline via the conference submission website. Please make sure your submission adheres to the following guidelines.  
    </o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">
  <font face="Arial">
    <o:p>
      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Paper Type and Length:</b> Please select one of the following two categories for your paper: (1) regular papers, and (2) tool and benchmark papers. The primary focus of "regular papers" should be to describe new research ideas supported by experimental implementation and evaluation of the proposed research ideas. The primary focus of "tool and benchmark papers" should be to describe the design, development, and evaluation of new open-source tools and/or benchmarks suites.  
    </o:p>
  </font>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">
  <font face="Arial">
    <o:p>
      Authors are also required to indicate the category of the paper as part of the submitted manuscript's title. The last line of the title should indicate the paper type by using one of the two phrases (1) Paper Type: Regular, or (2) Paper Type: Tool / Benchmark.  
    </o:p>
  </font>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">
  <font face="Arial">
    <o:p>
      Papers in the tool and benchmark category with relatively shorter length (6 pages) are welcome if the contributions can be well articulated and substantiated in 6 pages. However, all submissions in the tool and benchmark category have the flexibility of using all 10 pages (excluding references), similar to the papers in the regular category. .

      If you can express your contributions in fewer pages than the page-limit, the PC encourages you to do so. Papers can be at most 10 pages in a printable PDF format, not including references, and must use the two-column IEEE Proceedings format. There is no page limit for references. References must include all authors to facilitate the reviewing process (no et al.). Text must be minimum 9pt Times font. Please number the pages of your submission.

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Double-blind Review:</b> Paper submission is double-blind to reduce the reviewers' bias against the authors and/or their institutions. Thus, the submissions must not include author names or institutions. Careful writing should be used to preserve anonymity for submission. We recognize that building on your prior work may indirectly reveal your identity. Please reference your previous work in third person. Do not omit references to ensure anonymity, as this leaves reviewers unable to understand the full context. If you need to refer to another submission at IISWC currently under review, please mark the reference as anonymous under submission at IISWC'21, but alert the program chairs regarding this.  
    </o:p>

    <o:p>
      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Double Blind submission for Tool/Benchmark Papers:</b> All tool/benchmark papers should also adhere to the double-blind submission policy. If the described tool/benchmark framework is already widely used by the research community, consider describing the framework using a different name and not sharing the open-source code repository in the paper.

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Concurrent Submissions:</b> 
      By submitting a manuscript to IISWC ’21, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues, such as IEEE CAL, where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications.  Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, Web pages, or online repositories, such as <a href="arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>, are not considered prior publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity.   The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the IISWC ’21 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.  As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program chairs.  More details on the IEEE policies can be found in <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/index.html">https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/index.html</a>

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Optional Supplemental Information about Revisions:</b> Authors can upload a document listing the improvements made in response to the reviews received from a previously submitted version. Authors have two options: (1) not provide this information, or (2) provide this information, and the visibility is set to all the reviewers. The intent is to improve the efficiency of the over-burdened review process and benefit the authors who faithfully revise the paper to incorporate feedback from previous reviewers.

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest Declaration:</b> Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be summarily rejected. Please declare a conflict of interest (COI) with the following for any author of your paper: 
      
    <ul>
  <li>Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. </li>
  <li>Family relations by blood or marriage and close friends, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). You are a close friend with someone if you have or would spend a night at their home if you were visiting them, or vice versa. </li>
  <li>People with whom you have collaborated in the last five years, including <ul>
      <li>co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. </li>
      <li>co-PIs of accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals.  </li>
      <li>funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund.  </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People who shared your primary institution(s) and with whom you had research interactions (including brainstorming, reading groups, etc) in the last five years. </li>
   </ul>
      
      “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, close personal friends. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you must not declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The program chairs may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear. We hope to draw most reviewers from the PC, but others from the community may also write reviews. Please declare all your conflicts (not just restricted to the PC). When in doubt, contact the program chairs.

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusive Description of Research Contributions:</b> Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture rich, consider engaging users from diverse background if your research involves survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually-impaired or color-blind readers.

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Ethical Guidelines:</b> 
      <ul>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to encourage or solicit them to bid on any paper. </li>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively. </li>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers. </li>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to ask about the outcomes of any papers. </li>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to advertise their submissions or related technical reports and postings (e.g., to arxiv.org or online repositories) on social media or community blogs and webpages during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the IISWC’21 acceptance results are public. </li>
  <li>If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about the responsible disclosure. Overall, as appropriate and relevant, the paper should follow the ethical principles and not alter the security/privacy/equality expectations of the associated human users. </li>
      </ul>

      <b style="text-decoration: underline;">arXiv Submission Policy:</b> Please note that having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IISWC 2020. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers which have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).
