<h3>Title: Unveiling Security Engine's Time Machine: A Journey Through History and a Look into the Future</h3>
<p><img src="farimah.jpg" width="200" /></p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In today's landscape of increasing complexity of system-on-chip (SoC) designs, security stands as a paramount concern. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, access controls, provisioning of critical information within SoCs demands robust security measures. It is necessary to implement a secure and trusted component known as the root-of-trust (RoT), which forms the cornerstone of essential security and trust mechanisms within SoCs. In this keynote address, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of the requirements, components, and challenges involved in the design of a RoT, often referred to as the Security Engine. The Security Engine serves as a bulwark against various threats, both at the manufacturing floor and during in-field operations, safeguarding SoCs against potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we delve into the critical aspects of verification and validation of the Security Engine, essential steps in ensuring its efficacy and reliability in real-world scenarios. By covering these key concepts and methodologies, this presentation aims to provide attendees with valuable insights into the landscape of SoC security.</p>
